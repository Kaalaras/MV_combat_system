2. **v2.2 Release**: Evaluate multiplayer demand, prioritize networking vs single-player content
3. **v2.3 Release**: Mobile market assessment, determine platform priorities
4. **v3.0 Release**: Long-term sustainability planning, potential commercial release

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Performance Scaling**: Large battles may require significant optimization
- **Network Complexity**: Multiplayer introduces significant complexity

### Market Risks  
- **Niche Appeal**: World of Darkness theme may limit audience
- **Competition**: Many tactical combat games in market
- **Complexity**: Deep systems may intimidate casual players

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Modular Development**: Each phase can stand alone if needed
- **Early Testing**: Beta releases to gather feedback before major features
- **Platform Flexibility**: 2D fallback options for performance-constrained platforms
- **Accessibility**: Tutorials and difficulty options to broaden appeal

## Success Metrics

### Technical KPIs
- Test coverage >80% across all modules
- Performance: 60fps with 50+ entities
- Crash rate <0.1% in production
- Load times <5 seconds for standard battles

### User Experience KPIs  
- Tutorial completion rate >70%
- Average session length >30 minutes
- Player retention >40% after first week
- Community engagement (mods, maps created)

This roadmap provides a clear path from the current solid foundation to a comprehensive tactical combat system while managing complexity and risk appropriately.
