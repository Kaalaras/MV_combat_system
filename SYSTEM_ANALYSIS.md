   - Damage types: superficial, aggravated, magic
   - Weapon types: firearm, melee, brawl
   - Attack effects: penetration, area-of-effect (radius, cone)

3. **Cover System** (`core/cover_system.py`)
   - Line-of-sight based cover calculation
   - Partial wall bonuses (+2 successes)
   - Cover stacking rules
   - No cover penalty (-2 successes)

4. **Movement System** (`core/movement_system.py`)
   - Grid-based tactical movement
   - Pathfinding with A* algorithm
   - Opportunity attacks on movement
   - Multi-tile entity support

5. **Terrain System** (`core/terrain_manager.py`)
   - Dynamic terrain effects (dangerous, very dangerous, auras)
   - Terrain-based movement costs
   - Environmental hazards and darkness
   - Jump mechanics over void terrain

6. **Line of Sight System** (`core/los_manager.py`)
   - Ray-casting for visibility
   - Visibility caching with terrain version tracking
   - Invisibility and see-invisible conditions
   - Granular LOS calculations

7. **AI System** (`ecs/systems/ai/`)
   - Tactical AI with cover-seeking behavior
   - Range optimization for attacks
   - Team-based coordination capabilities
   - Retreat and defensive positioning

8. **Condition System** (`ecs/systems/condition_system.py`)
   - Stackable conditions with duration tracking
   - Damage modification conditions
   - Status effects (invisible, night vision)
   - Condition expiry management

### Entities
1. **Characters** (`entities/character.py`)
   - Vampire World of Darkness inspired traits
   - Health tracking (superficial/aggravated damage)
   - Equipment and inventory management
   - Disciplines and supernatural abilities

2. **Weapons** (`entities/weapon.py`)
   - Range, damage, and weapon type properties
   - Special effects (penetration, AoE)
   - Ammunition tracking

3. **Armor** (`entities/armor.py`)
   - Damage resistance by type
   - Armor degradation on damage

### Interface Systems
1. **UI Management** (`interface/`)
   - Event-driven UI updates
   - Player turn controller
   - Spectator mode for AI battles

## Test Coverage Analysis

### Well Tested Areas (95%+ coverage)
- Cover system mechanics
- Line of sight calculations
- Movement and pathfinding
- Basic combat resolution
- Terrain effects
- Condition system core functionality

### Areas Needing Enhanced Testing

#### Critical Edge Cases Missing
1. **Multi-entity simultaneous actions**
   - Multiple opportunity attacks triggered at once
   - Simultaneous terrain effect triggers
   - Race conditions in turn resolution

2. **Complex damage interactions**
   - Damage overflow from superficial to aggravated
   - Multiple damage modifiers stacking
   - Armor destruction during multi-hit attacks

3. **AI extreme scenarios**
   - AI behavior with no valid moves
   - AI decision making with multiple equal-value targets
   - AI pathfinding through dynamic obstacles

4. **Memory and performance edge cases**
   - Very large maps (>100x100)
   - High entity counts (>100 entities)
   - Long-running battles (>1000 turns)

#### Rare Game State Edge Cases
1. **Zero or negative dice pools**
   - Attack with 0 dice from penalties
   - Negative movement from terrain costs
   - Division by zero in calculations

2. **Boundary conditions**
   - Map edge interactions
   - Maximum stat values (999+ in traits)
   - Minimum values (0 or negative stats)

3. **State corruption scenarios**
   - Entity deletion during action resolution
   - Terrain modification mid-pathfinding
   - Condition removal during effect application
