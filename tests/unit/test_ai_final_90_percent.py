"""
Final AI System Tests to Achieve 90% Coverage
============================================

This test suite targets the remaining uncovered lines in ecs/systems/ai/main.py 
to achieve the 90% coverage goal. Each test is designed to hit specific code paths
that were identified in the coverage analysis.

Target Coverage: 90% (need to cover ~65 additional lines from current 76%)

Key areas targeted:
- Core decision logic (lines 487-567): Main AI choose_action flow
- Action execution paths (lines 573-590, 594-652): Event publishing & parameters
- Strategic retreat logic (lines 265-311): Retreat tile evaluation
- Combat positioning (lines 355-360, 394-458): LOS management & positioning
- Error handling and edge cases (lines 656-704): Exception handling

Each test includes detailed justification for its existence and covers specific
functionality that is critical for AI behavior in multiplayer scenarios.
